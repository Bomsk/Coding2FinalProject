Final Project Instruction:

Option 2: Work with an API to download all data, add error handling to your function, save your data, and push to GitHub. 
Read the data from git, perform data cleaning, transformations, and create at least 5 different plots (you can use plotly or plotnine, or your choice). 
Make sure that you also add your findings in text. 
Here, an example can be to download all Pokemon data. Post your findings, use gist for code embed.
